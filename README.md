âœ¨ Theme / Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project was to create a personal portfolio that reflects my personality and journey as a beginner web developer. I wanted it to feel simple, clean, and welcoming â€” like a digital introduction to who I am and what Iâ€™ve been learning.

ðŸŽ¨ Design Decisions

Color Scheme: I chose a black background with a gray sidebar to give the site a classic yet modern look. It also keeps the focus on the content.

Layout: I used a single-page structure for smooth navigation, with sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

Fonts & Icons: I used Google Fonts for a clean typographic look and Font Awesome for social icons in the footer.

Responsiveness: I made the layout readable across devices, though there's still room to improve mobile design.


ðŸ§— Challenges I Faced

While working on this project, I was sick and didnâ€™t feel 100%, but I still tried my best to complete it in the best way I could. One of the biggest challenges was dealing with broken section links and repeated IDs, which caused parts of the page to malfunction. It took time and effort to debug, especially while not feeling well, but I learned a lot during the process.
